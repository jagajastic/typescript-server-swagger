# Express Typescript server

Run the server with

```bash
yarn
# tsc compiles the typescript
yarn tsc
# start the server
yarn start
```

Documentation and GraphQL route

```bash
# swagger api
/api-docs
# GraphQL

/graphql

```

The server part of this system is already designed and exposes a set of REST endpoints via the `/api` route and a GraphQL endpoint.

The client has been setup to consume graphql if you chose to use that instead.
